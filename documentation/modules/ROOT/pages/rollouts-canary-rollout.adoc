In this module we will:

* Review and understand the Canary Strategy
* Deploy the Canary Rollout to the production namespace
* Promote a new image and observe the Canary behavior
* Replace a manual pause step for testing with an Analysis

[#canary-strategy]
== Canary Strategy

link:https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/canary/[Canary, window='_blank'] can be
thought of as an advanced version of blue-green. Instead of an abrupt cut-over
of live traffic between a current and new revision, traffic is instead gradually increased to the new
version in increments, or steps, while simultaneously decreasing the current revision. Like the
proverbial link:https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine[canary in the coal mine,window="_blank"],
the intent is to allow users to access the new version over time and if unexpected problems occur revert back to the
previous version.

This process is depicted in the diagram below that shows how traffic is slowly migrated from
the current revision to the new revision until the process is completed.

image::overview-canary.png[]

To manage the transition of traffic between stable and canary services, Argo Rollouts supports a variety
of link:https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/traffic-management/[traffic management, window='_blank'] solutions. In
the absence of a traffic management solution, Rollouts will manage traffic weight on a best effort basis by adjusting
the number of pod replicas associated with each service.

[NOTE]
Argo Rollouts does not currently have support for traffic shaping for OpenShift Routes. This
work is in progress and will be available in the future as Rollouts moves to GA status
in OpenShift GitOps. For this module we will rely on Rollouts best effort approach.

[#deploy-canary-rollout]
== Deploy Canary Rollout

Now we will deploy the canary rollout in the `user%USERNUM%-prod` namespace following the same process that we did for the
blue-green in the previous modules. Prior to starting, confirm you are still at the correct path.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cd ~/argo-rollouts-workshop/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/
----

Next, let's explore the manifests that we will be deploying in the `./canary/base` folder:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
ls ./canary/base
----

Similar to previous modules, note we have files for `rollout.yaml`, `services.yaml` and `routes.yaml` which are
our Kubernetes resources for Rollout, Services and Routes respectively. Examining the Rollout first you will
see the following:

.link:https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/argo-rollouts-workshop/blob/main/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/canary/base/rollout.yaml[./canary/base/rollout.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$canary/base/rollout.yaml[]
----

In the rollout manifest we have changed our strategy from blue-green to canary. In the canary strategy, like the blue-green strategy, we specify
the services to use however here they are `stable` and `canary` services. Unlike blue-green we explicitly define the promotion process by
specifying a series of discrete steps. At each step we can set the traffic weight between the services, pause or perform an
inline analysis.

For this example, the first step sets the weight to 20% and then the second step pauses indefinitely since no duration
is specified. This will allow us to observe the behavior of the canary and validate that it is
performing as expected before performing a manual promotion.

Once the manual promotion has been performed, the remaining steps will continue to increase the
traffic weight with short pauses between each step. For the pause step the duration can be
specified in seconds(s), minutes(m) or hours(h) increments.

[NOTE]
For the purposes of this workshop the pause sequences are deliberately short, it is common
to have much longer pauses for more complex applications.

Next let's look at the Kubernetes services that are defined:

.link:https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/argo-rollouts-workshop/blob/main/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/canary/base/services.yaml[./canary/base/services.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$canary/base/services.yaml[]
----

As expected, services have been defined `stable` and `canary` as referenced in the Rollout, however there is a new service called
`all`. This `all` service is not managed by the rollout and includes all pods, this service is used
to observe the behavior of rollouts as traffic weight shifts between stable and canary services.

[Important]
As mentioned previously, Argo Rollouts does not currently have support for traffic shaping for
OpenShift Routes. As a result we will be relying on the best effort approach of scaling pods.
The `all` service will enable us to see this by including all pods.

With the services out of the way, let's examine the routes:

.link:https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/argo-rollouts-workshop/blob/main/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/canary/base/routes.yaml[./canary/base/routes.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$canary/base/routes.yaml[]
----

Here a route has been defined to match each service that were shown previously. Note for the `all` route,
OpenShift Route annotations are being used to disable sticky sessions and use round-robin
load balancing. This enables us to properly observe the split of traffic as Rollouts manage the pod
replicas between stable and canary services without interference from OpenShift's load balancer.

To deploy the canary rollout, use the following command to process the kustomization:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc apply -k ./canary/base -n user%USERNUM%-prod
----

Once you have run the command we can confirm that the rollout has deployed successfully. Use the following command to ensure
that the rollout is up and running and in a Healthy state:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc argo rollouts get rollout rollouts-demo -n user%USERNUM%-prod
----

The console should return something similar to:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]

The command shows additional information about the canary rollout including the
number of steps and the weight between services.

Confirm the application is accessible, retrieve the stable route URL using the
command below and copy to a browser tab:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get route -n user%USERNUM%-prod stable -o jsonpath='{"https://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
----

The application is running with blue squares for the current version of the application:

If you go to the Argo Rollouts Dashboard you can see that the dashboard displays
the steps that are defined in the rollout. Again, the dashboard URL can be retrieved
through the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get route -n user%USERNUM%-tools dashboard -o jsonpath='{"https://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
----

[#promote-image]
== Promote Image

In this section we will promote a new image and observe the behavior of the canary rollout using
the same pipeline that we used previously. As a reminder, the pipeline can be accessed in
the `user%USERNUM%-tools` namespace.

image::console-pipelines-overview.png[]

Go ahead and start the pipeline selecting the green image and wait for the pipeline to complete:

image::console-promote-params.png[]

Once the pipeline is complete, run this command to see state of the rollout:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc argo rollouts get rollout rollouts-demo -n user%USERNUM%-prod

----

There are a few things of note here. First the status of the Rollout is `Paused` due
to the pause step with no duration. Second that we have two ReplicaSets, one with 2 pods
and the other with 7 pods corresponding to the preview and stable services respectively.
Recall in our first step that we set a weight of 20% to the canary service.

Next visit the Argo Rollouts Dashboard and note that the the rollout is paused on the `pause`
step:

image::argo-rollouts-dashboard-canary-pause.png[]

Now let's see the behavior of the routes, first if you check the stable you will see
the blue version of the application:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get route -n user%USERNUM%-prod stable -o jsonpath='{"https://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
----

image::rollouts-demo-app-blue.png[]

Next if we check the canary version of the application we should see the green version
of the application.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get route -n user%USERNUM%-prod canary -o jsonpath='{"https://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
----

image::rollouts-demo-app-green.png[]

Finally if we check the version of the application being delivered by the `all` route
which includes all pods there will be approximately 20% green squares versus 80%
blue squares:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get route -n user%USERNUM%-prod all -o jsonpath='{"https://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
----

image::rollouts-demo-app-canary-blue-green.png[]

To promote the rollout, you can either promote it from the dashboard using the `Promote`
button or you can promote it using the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc argo rollouts promote rollouts-demo -n user%USERNUM%-prod
----

Observe the dashboard once it has been promoted. The dashboard will show the progression
of the steps by highlighting each step as it is being executed. Also note how pods are
being drained from one service to the other as traffic weighting changes.

Prior to moving on to the next section, perform a cleanup to remove the current rollout
and reset the Deployment in the dev environment back to blue.

Update the deployment:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc apply -k ./deploy/base -n user%USERNUM%-dev
----

Delete the current rollout:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc delete -k ./canary/base -n user%USERNUM%-prod
----

[#inline-analysis]
== Inline Analysis

In the last section there was a pause step that provided an opportunity to manually test the canary
before progressing further. However we can accomplish the same goal by using an analysis. With
respect to the canary strategy, an analysis can be performed in the link:https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/analysis/#background-analysis[background,window='_blank']
or as an link:https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/analysis/#inline-analysis[inline] analysis.

A Background Analysis happens asynchronously and does not block the progression of steps, however
if the analysis fails it will abort the rollout similar to what we saw in the previous module with
the blue-green strategy. In the case of an Inline Analysis, the analysis is performed as a discrete step
and will block the progression of the rollout until it completes.

In the following example we will implement an Inline Analysis. The files for this example are in the `./canary-analysis/base` folder, to view the list of files
perform an `ls` as follows:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
ls ./canary-analysis/base
----

Note that the files are identical to the previous example other than the `rollout.yaml` and the
`analysistemplate.yaml` file. The AnalysisTemplate being used here is identical to the one
we used in the blue-green example so we will not cover it again here.

The one change in the rollout is that it now has an inline analysis step as per below:

.link:https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/argo-rollouts-workshop/blob/main/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/canary-analysis/base/rollout.yaml[./canary-analysis/base/rollout.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$canary-analysis/base/rollout.yaml[]
----

Notice that the structure of the inline analysis is identical to what was used in the `prePromotionAnalysis`
in the blue-green rollout with analysis.

To deploy the canary with the inline analysis execute the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kustomize build ./canary-analysis/base | sed "s/%SUB_DOMAIN%/$SUB_DOMAIN/" | sed "s/%USER%/%USERNUM%/" | oc apply -n user%USERNUM%-prod -f -
----

Once the command has been executed, verify that the rollout was deployed:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc argo rollouts get rollout rollouts-demo -n user%USERNUM%-prod
----

You should see output as follows:

[.console-output]

----

Next, examining the Argo Rollouts Dashboard we can see the inline Analysis being shown with the other steps:

image::argo-rollouts-dashboard-canary-analysis.png[]

Note that since we no longer have a manual pause step the promotion will complete automatically as long as the
analysis step executes successfully.

Let's do our promotion to the `green` image, go to the `user%USERNUM%-tools` namespace and start the pipeline
again. Once the pipeline has completed, observe the behavior of the canary deployment during the process in
the Argo Rollouts Dashboard.

[NOTE]
If you want to try this multiple times to look at different things feel free to use the pipeline
to deploy different colors. Remember the available colors are available .link:https://quay.io/repository/openshiftdemos/rollouts-demo?tab=tags[here, window='_blank'].

In the dashboard, if you catch it before it completes, you can see the analysis step executing. Similar to
what we saw in the previous module, the analysis button will be grey while it is executing, green when it
has completed successfully or red if it failed. Here is what the dashboard looks like while the
analysis is executing:

image::argo-rollouts-dashboard-analysis-executing.png[]

Once the promotion is completed, the dashboard will appear as follows:

image::argo-rollouts-dashboard-analysis-completed.png[]

In the command line, you can view the rollout using the command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]

In this module the canary strategy for Argo Rollouts has been reviewed along
with how to use an inline analysis step to perform testing of the canary deployment.
