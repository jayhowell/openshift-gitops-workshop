= Installing GitOps with ACM
include::_attributes.adoc[]


=== *Deploying Policies with Policy Generator*

This Policy Generator definition will achieve 2 configuration policies:

____
*openshift-gitops-installed:* The goal of the first one is to inform if
the OpenShift GitOps operator is installed on managed clusters.

*kubeadmin-removed*: The goal of this second policy is to inform if the
kubeadmin user is removed from managed clusters.
____

Both policies are informative only and will only execute them manually
to showcase how to resolve issues.

In order to deliver these policies we will need to leverage the RHACM
Application engine and the GitOps Subscription model.

*[.underline]#Pre-requisite#*: Before we start, on the *local-cluster*,
make sure to add a label if it’s not there yet: *rhdp_usage=development*

Let’s just do *one more step*: This step insures that our lab user has the right permissions to create policies with policy generator. Login to your Cluster and click the + sign at the top.  Past the following yaml and click apply. 

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: open-cluster-management:subscription-admin
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: open-cluster-management:subscription-admin
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User

- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: system:admin
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: admin

Now, in the *ACM UI*, navigate to *Applications*.

Click *Create application*, select *Subscription*. Enter the following
information:

____
* *Name*: policy-generator +
* *Namespace*: policy-generator +
* Under repository types, select the *GIT* *repository* +
** *URL*:
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-partners-public/red-hat-demos/acm-demo-policygenerator.git[https://gitlab.com/gitlab-partners-public/red-hat-demos/acm-demo-policygenerator.git] +
* *Branch*: main +
*Under *[.underline]#Select cluster for application deployment#*, Select 
*global* clusterSet and *Deploy only to local cluster* +
** *Label*: name - equals any of - *Value*: local-cluster
* Verify all the information is correct. *Click Create*
____



It will take a few minutes to deploy the application, Click on the
*Topology Tab* to view and verify that all of the circles are green.

Navigate to the *Governance* menu.

Click on the *Policies* tab.

Verify that you see 2 policies:
____
* *kubeadmin-removed*
* *openshift-gitops-installed*
____

image:image3.png[]

Notice that the *kubeadmin* and the *openshift-gitops* policies shows ✅
(compliant). This means there’s no kubeadmin password in this cluster,
which is a best practice. And that OpenShift GitOps is installed. If you
didn’t stall OpenShift GitOps manually through the Operator Hub the Governance would report a violation
❗.

If that’s the case, you can go ahead and enforce them.

____
On the *openshift-gitops-installed* policy, click on the ellipses and
set policy to *Enforce*
____

image:image7.png[]

Click the *Enforce* button to verify +
Wait a few minutes and you will see that the *Cluster Violations* will
go from *red* to *green. +

Click on the Policy and select Results. Verify that the *GitOps*
*operator* has been installed.*


Feel free to repeat the steps with the *kubeadmin-removed* *Policy*,
however if you enforce this in a cluster that has no other Identity
provider configured, you won’t be able to access that cluster through
the console as the only account created on these clusters is Kubadmin.

Now you have succesfully created a Policy leveraing the Policy Generator
to scan your clusters, if you would like to play with other policies
please visit the
