[#cluster-login]
== OpenShift cluster login

The first thing to do is log in to your OpenShift cluster. In the previous
screen that handed you your workshop credentials should be a link to the
OpenShift console, as well as a username and password. Click that link, which
will take you to the OpenShift login screen:

Once logged in, make sure that you choose the _Developer_ perspective using the
switcher in the upper-left:

[#open-web-terminal]
== OpenShift Web Terminal

OpenShift conveniently provides a web-based terminal that includes many of the
necessary command-line tools you need to interact with. You can open the web
terminal by clicking its launcher button on the upper right menu, near your
username:

You will be asked to choose which project in which to initialize your terminal.
This workshop has created several Kubernetes namespaces (OpenShift projects) for
you. It doesn't _really_ matter which one you choose, but we recommend that you
initialize your terminal in the tools project:
`user%USERNUM%-tools`.

Once the terminal is launched, you'll see it at the bottom of your screen:

You probably want to pop-out the terminal into a new browser window/tab so that
you can see the OpenShift console with your full screen. There's a pop-out
button on the right side:

[TIP]
====
In order to copy and paste content into the terminal, you can use
the secondary (typically right click) menus to do so. You can also
use the keyboard to paste content with the shortcut &lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;shift&gt;&lt;v&gt;.
