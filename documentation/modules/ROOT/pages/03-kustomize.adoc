link:https://kustomize.io/[Kustomize] traverses a Kubernetes manifest to add,
remove or update configuration options without forking. It is available both as
a standalone binary and as a native feature of both `oc` and `kubectl`.

[#exploring_kustomize]
== Exploring Kustomize

The principles of `kustomize` are:

* Purely declarative approach to configuration customization
* Manage an arbitrary number of distinctly customized Kubernetes configurations
* Every artifact that kustomize uses is plain YAML and can be validated and
  processed as such
* As a "templateless" templating system; it encourages using YAML without
  forking the repo it.

[#exploring_kustomize_cli]
== Exploring the Kustomize CLI

The `kustomize` CLI should have been installed as part of the lab
setup. Verify that it has been installed.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kustomize version --short
----


This should display the version, it should look something like this.

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
{kustomize/v4.5.7  2022-08-02T16:35:54Z  }
----


Kustomize, at its core, is meant to build on top of native Kubernetes manifests
based on YAML while leaving the original YAML intact. It achieves this in a
"template-less" templating format. This is done by providing a
`kustomization.yaml` file.

We will be focusing on two Kustomize sub-commands: the `build` command and the
`edit` command.

=== Kustomize `build`

The `build` command takes the YAML source (via a path or URL) and creates a new
YAML that can be piped into `oc create`. We will work with an example in the
`documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/kustomize-build` directory within the
repository you cloned.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cd ~/openshift-gitops-workshop/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/kustomize-build
----

Here you should see two files, a `welcome.yaml` file and a `kustomization.yaml` file, let's have a look at them.

.link:https://gitlab.com/gitlab-partners-public/red-hat-demos/jay-howell-openshift-gitops-workshop/blob/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/kustomize-build/welcome.yaml[welcome.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$kustomize-build/welcome.yaml[]
----

This file shows nothing special. Just a standard Kubernetes `Deployment` manifest.

Now what if, for example, we wanted to add a `label` to this manifest without
editing it? This is where the `kustomization.yaml` file comes in.

.link:https://gitlab.com/gitlab-partners-public/red-hat-demos/jay-howell-openshift-gitops-workshop/blob/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/kustomize-build/kustomization.yaml[kustomization.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$kustomize-build/kustomization.yaml[]
----

As you can see in the output, we only need a `resources` and a `patches` section to accomplish this:

- The `resources` is an array of individual files, directories, and/or URLs where
other manifests are stored. In this example we are just loading in one file.
- The link:https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/patches/[`patches`,window="blank"] is where we add our label to this manifest.

[NOTE]
====
You can read about what options are available for patching in the
https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/[official
documentation site,window="blank"]
====

Build this manifest by running:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kustomize build
----

You can see that the new label got added to the manifest!

[.console-output]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: welcome-php
    testkey: testvalue # Our new label
  name: welcome-php
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: welcome-php
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: welcome-php
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: quay.io/redhatworkshops/welcome-php:latest
        name: welcome-php
        resources: {}
        securityContext:
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
          capabilities:
            drop:
            - ALL
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        seccompProfile:
          type: RuntimeDefault
----

=== Kustomize `edit`

You can use the `kustomize edit` command to make manifest changes instead of manually writing YAML. For
example, you can change the image tag the `Deployment` above uses from `latest`
to `ffcd15` by running the following:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kustomize edit set image quay.io/redhatworkshops/welcome-php:ffcd15
----

This will update the `kustomization.yaml` file with an `images` section.
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cat kustomization.yaml
----

[.console-output]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- ./welcome.yaml
patches:
- patch: |-
    - op: add
      path: /metadata/labels/testkey
      value: testvalue
  target:
    group: apps
    kind: Deployment
    name: welcome-php
    version: v1
images:
- name: quay.io/redhatworkshops/welcome-php
  newTag: ffcd15
----

Now when you run:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
 kustomize build .
----

You should see not only the new label, but also the new `ffcd15` image tag!
[.console-output]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: welcome-php
    testkey: testvalue
  name: welcome-php
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: welcome-php
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: welcome-php
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: quay.io/redhatworkshops/welcome-php:ffcd15
        name: welcome-php
        resources: {}
        securityContext:
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
          capabilities:
            drop:
            - ALL
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        seccompProfile:
          type: RuntimeDefault
----

[NOTE]
====
You may have to close the `kustomization.yaml` tab and re-open it to
see the changes.
====

You can now see how you can take existing YAML and modify it for
your specific environment without the need to copy or edit the original.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Kustomize can also be used to write a new YAML file and pipe it into
the `oc` (or `kubectl`) command for immediate execution in your environment. Example:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kustomize build . | oc apply -f -
----
====

[#exploring_kustomize_with_oc]
== Exploring Kustomize with `oc`

The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) has support for Kustomize built in.
It inherits this from `kubectl` which has had this same support since Kubernetes 1.14.

You can see this by running:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc kustomize --help
----

You can run the `kustomize build` command by doing:

[.console-input]
----
oc kustomize
----

Although you can use `oc kustomize` and pipe it into the `oc apply` command, you
don't have to. The `oc apply` command has the `-k` option that
will run the build before it applies the manifest.

[NOTE]
====
`oc kustomize` and `kubectl kustomize` implement a subset of the `kustomize`
featureset. For example, the `edit` command is not implemented.
====

Now you will apply your `kustomize`-d `Deployment` manifest into one of your projects:

[NOTE]
====
Ensure that you are in the `~/openshift-gitops-workshop/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/kustomize-build` directory
====

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc apply -n user%USERNUM%-bgdk -k .
----

You should see the following letting you know the deployment was successful
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
deployment.apps/welcome-php created
----

[NOTE]
====
You can pass not only directories, but URLs as well.
The only requirement is that you have a `kustomization.yaml` file in the path.
====

Now that the deployment is created, you should see the pods running in the namespace with

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get pods -n user%USERNUM%-bgdk
----

The console should return something along the lines of

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
welcome-php-9474fc448-sthzr   1/1     Running   0          34s
----

You can also see the deployment was created with the additional labels

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get deployment welcome-php -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels}' -n user%USERNUM%-bgdk | jq -r
----

Resulting in
[.console-output]
[source,json,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
{
  "app": "welcome-php",
  "testkey": "testvalue"
}
----

Finally, check that the image was updated based on the customization we made

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get deploy welcome-php -n user%USERNUM%-bgdk -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[].image}{"\n"}'
----

The output should return
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
quay.io/redhatworkshops/welcome-php:ffcd15
----

As you can see `kustomize` can be a powerful tool.

You can delete the applied resources with `oc delete` and kustomize, too

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc delete -n user%USERNUM%-bgdk -k .
----

Once you run this command, check that you see the following to confirm deletion

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
deployment.apps "welcome-php" deleted
----

[#deploying_kustomized_application]
== Deploying Kustomized Application

In Chapter 2 - GitOps Basics, you learned that in a GitOps workflow the
entire application stack (including infrastructure) is reflected
in a Git repo. The challenge is how to do this without duplicating
YAML.

So now that you've explored `kustomize`, let's see how it fits into Argo
CD and how it can be used in a GitOps workflow.

Before proceeding, move back into the examples home directory:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cd ~/openshift-gitops-workshop/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples
----

[#kustomized_application]
=== Kustomized Application

Argo CD has native support for Kustomize. You can use this to avoid
duplicating YAML for each deployment. This is especially helpful if you
have different environments or clusters you're deploying to.

Take a look at this `Application` definition:

.link:https://gitlab.com/gitlab-partners-public/red-hat-demos/jay-howell-openshift-gitops-workshop/blob/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgdk-app.yaml[bgdk-app.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$bgdk-app.yaml[]
----

As you will see below, this `Application` definition refers to the same **base** resources you used in
Chapter 2. It references a directory path (`documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgdk`)
which contains a new `kustomization.yaml` file specific to this application. This concept is called an **overlay**.
Where a **base** set of manifests are **overlay**-d with your customizations.

Click link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/#bases-and-overlays[here,window='_blank'] to learn more about Kustomize bases and overlays, 

Now take a look at this `Kustomization` defintion:

.link:https://gitlab.com/gitlab-partners-public/red-hat-demos/jay-howell-openshift-gitops-workshop/blob/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgdk/kustomization.yaml[kustomization.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$bgdk/kustomization.yaml[]
----

This `kustomization.yaml` takes the base application located at `documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgd-base`
and patches the `Deployment` manifest so that you get yellow dots instead of blue ones.

Now deploy this application:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
sed 's/$USERNUM/%USERNUM%/' ~/openshift-gitops-workshop/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgdk-app.yaml | oc apply -n user%USERNUM%-argocd -f -
----

[#argocd_web_console]
=== The Argo CD Web Console

Switch back to the Argo CD Web UI, you may be
presented with the Argo CD login screen again.

image::argo-cd-login.png[ArgoCD Login]

You can login using your the same credential you used for OpenShift which
were provided by the workshop administrator.

This should now show you two apps on the Argo CD UI.

image::two-apps.png[Two Apps]

Open the Route for this application. It's in the `user%USERNUM%-bgdk` Project.
Remember you can get this from the topology view, or from the CLI:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get route -n user%USERNUM%-bgdk bgd -o jsonpath='{"http://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
----

You should see yellow balls flying around. This is the same application you used
previously, and so you know that by changing the environment variable on the
deployment you can change the ball color.

Argo CD deployed the application with your `kustomize`-ations! To review what we
just did:

* Deployed an Application called `bgd` with a blue square.
* Deployed another Application based on `bgd` called `bgdk`
* The Application `bgdk` was deployed in its own namespace, with deployment
  customizations.
* ALL without having to duplicate YAML!
