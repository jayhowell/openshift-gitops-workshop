An Argo CD instance dedicated for you has been deployed into the OpenShift
Project `user%USERNUM%-argocd`. This is one of the benefits of the
Operator-based mechanism that OpenShift uses: it's easy for users to deploy
software and solutions.

[#review-argocd]
== Review the Argo CD Deployment

In the OpenShift web console, with the _Developer_ perspective active, click the
_Topology_ link in the left navigation and make sure that the
`user%USERNUM%-argocd` Project is selected at the top. You will see the Argo CD
deployment in the topology view:

[#connect-argocd]
== Connecting to Argo CD

While Argo CD generates a default `admin` user and a random password when first
deployed you can also configure Argo CD to use the OpenShift authentication.
You can connect to Argo CD using this user account via the CLI or web
console.  In this workshop, we will only use the Argo CD web console.

There are a few ways to find the URL for your Argo CD instance. In the _Topology_ view of your Project, any Routes/Ingresses associated with
services will have a little pop-out icon:

image::argocd-topology-link.png[]

You can find all of the Routes by clicking the _Project_ link on the left, and
then clicking _Route_ on the subsequent page.

Also, you can get the Argo CD Route using the `oc` CLI:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get route -n user%USERNUM%-argocd user%USERNUM%-argo-server -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
----

However you decide to access the Argo CD console, log in with the same username
and password that you used to login in with OpenShift.

image::argo-cd-login.png[ArgoCDLogin, 600]

After you enter your credentials you will see the following prompting you to authorize acess,
click the "Allow selected permissions" button.

image::argo-cd-allow-access.png[ArgoCDAuthorize, 600]

Once you've logged in, you should see the following page. This is the Argo CD
Web UI.

[#deploy-sample-application]
== Deploy a Sample Application

As GitOps implies some relationship to Git, we will need to get manifests from a
repository somewhere. You will be using the repository that contains this
workshop and its documentation as the source of the manifests that define the
application state:

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-partners-public/red-hat-demos/jay-howell-openshift-gitops-workshop[https://gitlab.com/gitlab-partners-public/red-hat-demos/jay-howell-openshift-gitops-workshop,window="_blank']

=== Clone the Repository

You need to clone the repository into your web terminal because you will need to
make very small changes to some of the files for the examples:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
git clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-partners-public/red-hat-demos/jay-howell-openshift-gitops-workshop ~/openshift-gitops-workshop
----

All of the example content will be located in:

`~/openshift-gitops-workshop/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples`

[IMPORTANT]
====
The web terminal only supports ephemeral storage. If you shut it down, or if it
times out, any local filesystem changes made will be lost. This means you would
need to clone the repository again. The web terminal is intended for
troubleshooting and simple interaction, and not as a long-lived remote execution
environment. For that, something like
https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[OpenShift
DevSpaces] is a better choice.
====

=== Review the Application Manifests

For this first lab, the application manifests are located link:https://gitlab.com/gitlab-partners-public/red-hat-demos/jay-howell-openshift-gitops-workshop/blob/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgd[here,window='_blank'] and include a Deployment, Service, and Route.
If you want to review these in your terminal, the files can be found here:

`~/openshift-gitops-workshop/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgd`


[IMPORTANT]
====
Review, but do not apply these manifests to your cluster. You will do that
shortly using Argo CD.
====

A *Deployment*:

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]

include::ROOT:example$bgd/bgd-deployment.yaml[]
----

A *Service*:

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$bgd/bgd-svc.yaml[]
----

A *Route*:

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----

=== Deploy the Application

A managed collection of manifests is known as an `Application` within Argo CD.
Therefore, you must define it as such using an
link:https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#applications[Application
CR (CustomResource)^] in order to have Argo CD apply these manifests in your
cluster.

Let's review the `Application` manifest used to deploy this application (found link:https://gitlab.com/gitlab-partners-public/red-hat-demos/jay-howell-openshift-gitops-workshop/blob/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgd-app.yaml[here,window="_blank"])
and break this down a bit:

.link:https://gitlab.com/gitlab-partners-public/red-hat-demos/jay-howell-openshift-gitops-workshop/blob/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgd-app.yaml[bgd-app.yaml,window="_blank"]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: bgd-app
spec:
  destination:
    namespace: user$USERNUM-bgd
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc <1>
  project: default <2>
  source: <3>
    path: documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgd
    repoURL: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-partners-public/red-hat-demos/jay-howell-openshift-gitops-workshop
    targetRevision: master
  syncPolicy: <4>
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: false
----
<1> The destination server is API endpoint for the cluster where Argo CD is
  running -- in this case, using the locally-resolveable URL for the cluster
<2> Here you're installing the application in Argo CD's `default` project
  (`.spec.project`).
[NOTE]
Argo CD's concept of a `Project` is different than OpenShift's. Here you're
installing the application in Argo CD's `default` project (`.spec.project`).
*NOT* OpenShift's default project.
<3> The manifest repo, and the path within it where the YAML resides.
<4> The `syncPolicy` is set to `automated`. It will automatically prune
  resources that have been removed from the Git repo, but will not automatically
  correct resources that deviate from the definition stored in the repo, i.e
  manual changes made using `oc` or `kubectl` will not be "healed".

You will create an Application by slightly modifying the provided example inline
using the command below:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
sed 's/$USERNUM/%USERNUM%/' ~/openshift-gitops-workshop/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgd-app.yaml | oc apply -n user%USERNUM%-argocd -f -
----

The newly created Application appears as a tile with the title `bgd-app` in the
Argo CD UI.

image::argocd-app1.png[SampleApp]

Clicking on this tile takes you to the application details page. You may see it
as still progressing or fully synced.

image::argocd-app2.png[SampleApp]

At this point the application should be up and running. Verify that the
resources were created:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get all -n user%USERNUM%-bgd
----

The output should list several things:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/bgd-74cf584546-tlqdm   1/1     Running   0          12m

NAME          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/bgd   ClusterIP   172.30.124.158   <none>        8080/TCP   12m

NAME                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/bgd   1/1     1            1           12m

NAME                             DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/bgd-74cf584546   1         1         1       12m

NAME                           HOST/PORT                                                       PATH   SERVICES   PORT   TERMINATION   WILDCARD
route.route.openshift.io/bgd   bgd-user3-bgd.apps.cluster-7pjzx.7pjzx.sandbox141.opentlc.com          bgd        8080                 None
----


**Extra Credit:** Do you know why you have a ReplicaSet?

Wait for the rollout of the new pods to happen in the deployment:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc rollout status deploy/bgd -n user%USERNUM%-bgd
----

If it is successful, you can now visit the deployed application in the browser.

From the OpenShift web console, select *user%USERNUM%-bgd* Project from
drop-down menu, and use the _Topology_ view to find the link as you did with
the Argo CD console.

image::bgdapp.png[BGD App]

Alternatively, get the app Route from the CLI:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get route bgd -n user%USERNUM%-bgd -o jsonpath='{"http://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
----

WARNING: This route is only available via HTTP. If you try to visit via HTTPS,
you will get an _Application not available_ error. Do you know why that is?

Your application should look like this.

image::bgd.png[SampleApp]

=== Addressing Configuration Drift

Let's introduce a change in the application environment! Patch the live
Deployment manifest to change the color of the bubbles in the application from
blue to green:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]

----
oc -n user%USERNUM%-bgd patch deploy/bgd --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/env/0/value", "value":"green"}]'
----

Wait for the rollout of the new pods to happen in the deployment:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc rollout status deploy/bgd -n user%USERNUM%-bgd
----

Refresh the browser tab where your application is running. You should see green
bubbles.

image::bgd-green.png[BDG Green]

Looking over at your Argo CD Web UI, you can see that Argo detects your
application as "Out of Sync".

image::out-of-sync.png[Out of Sync]

You can sync your app via the Argo CD by:

* First clicking `SYNC`
* Then clicking `SYNCHRONIZE`

After the sync process is done, the Argo CD UI should mark the application as in
sync.

image::fullysynced.png[Fully Synced]

Reload the page on the tab where the application is running. The bubbles should
have returned to their original blue color.

image::bgd.png[BDG App]

You can set up Argo CD to automatically correct drift by setting the `selfHeal`
property of the `Application` manifest to do so. Using the example from link:#_deploy_the_application[above]:

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
# bgd-app.yaml
...
spec:
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true # Set this to true
----

Or, as in our case, after the fact by running the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc patch application/bgd-app -n user%USERNUM%-argocd --type=merge -p='{"spec":{"syncPolicy":{"automated":{"prune":true,"selfHeal":true}}}}'
----
